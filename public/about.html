<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Chiemezie Uchenwoke, I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, <br/> JavaScript, WordPress, and libraries like Bootstrap. My experience in front-end <br/> development and social media advertising allows me to build engaging and <br/> user-friendly web interfaces that not only attract visitors but turn them into loyal <br/> customers.</p>


<p>I have been able to transition from being a WordPress developer to a Frontend <br/> Developer with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I am a result-oriented, goal-driven, problem-solving frontend developer with a <br/> passion for creating innovative solutions. I am driven by a desire for growth and <br/> making a difference in life. I am eager to grow my skills and take on new <br/> challenges.</p>
