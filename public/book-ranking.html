    <h3>Be All You Can Be By John Maxwell</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite. You have big dreams and major goals <br/> for your life. You want to be a leader, fulfilled and fully realized, <br/> always able to take what life throws at you and stretch beyond the <br/> status quo. But for some reason, you never quite get there. You just <br/> aren't living up to your potential, and you don't know why. In this book, <br/> you'll find the answers you're looking for.</p>
    
    <h3>5 Levels of Leadership by John Maxwell</h3>
    <p>Maxwell defines the “five levels of leadership” as “position, permission, <br/>  production, people development” and “pinnacle.” He explains that to <br/> advance to higher levels, you must go beyond Level 1, where you use <br/> your position to influence others, and grow to Level 2, building <br/> relationships; Level 3, producing results; Level 4, developing your <br/> employees' talents; and Level 5, creating future leaders.</p>
    
    <h3>7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey</h3>
    <p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey provides a <br/> transformative guide for personal and professional success. It emphasizes <br/> proactive thinking, prioritization, effective communication, collaboration, and <br/> personal growth. Covey’s seven habits—being proactive, beginning with the <br/> end in mind, putting first things first, thinking win-win, seeking to understand <br/> before being understood, synergizing, and sharpening the saw—empower <br/> individuals to take control of their lives, align their actions with their values, <br/> and build meaningful relationships. By practicing these habits, readers can <br/> enhance their effectiveness, achieve their goals, and experience greater <br/> fulfillment in all aspects of life.</p>
    
    <p><em><strong>These were the books that impacted my life and laid the right foundation <br/> for living a fulfilling and an impactful life.</strong></em></p>
    
    <p>I highly recommend them to anyone who desires to live an impactful life.</p>
